<div><h2>MARC Records Migration to FOLIO</h2>
<p>
  Stanford's migration of bibliographic data from our legacy ILS to FOLIO Library Services Platform,
  is built with multiple open-source technologies. Our workflow DAGs and plugins are also licensed under
  the Apache2 license and are available from <a href="https://github.com/sul-dlss/libsys-airflow/">LibSys Airflow</a>
  repository.
</p>
<h3>FOLIO-FSE Migration Tools</h3>
<p>
  Stanford's DAGs use the open-source tools  <a href="https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/folio_migration_tools/">FOLIO Migration Tools</a> 
  and <a href="https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/FolioClient">FolioClient</a> developed by Ebsco's FOLIO-FSE team for the majority of 
  the core migration from MARC21 binary and tab-separated files (TSV) to FOLIO Instances, Holdings, and Items records. 
</p>
<h2>Directed Acyclic Graph Workflows</h2>
<h3><em>auto_bib_loads</em> DAG</h3>
<p>
  To start the workflow, we copy MARC21 files along with those records holdings and items information into TSV files into a 
  mounted directory in the Airflow environment.

<h4>Tasks for <em>auto_bib_load</em> DAG</h4>
<ol>
  <li>When the DAG is manually triggered, the <strong>create_bib_loads</strong> task iterates
  through the mounted directory and creates groupings of records.</li>
  <li>As a temporary fix, the <strong>launch_ol_management</strong> task triggers the <em>optimistic_locking_management</em> 
  DAG that removes the optimistic locking of FOLIO inventory records to facilitate easier batch imports.</li>
  <li>The final task, <strong>launch_bib_imports</strong> triggers multiple runs of <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG based on 
   the number of record groups from the <strong>create_bib_loads</strong>. The <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG is configured
   so the maximum number of simultaneous is three, with any remaining DAG runs being queued and launched when one of three
   slots open up after a DAG run is completed</li>
