<div><h2>MARC Records Migration to FOLIO</h2>
<p>
  Stanford's migration of bibliographic data from our legacy ILS to FOLIO Library Services Platform,
  is built with multiple open-source technologies. Our workflow DAGs and plugins are also licensed under
  the Apache2 license and are available from <a href="https://github.com/sul-dlss/libsys-airflow/">LibSys Airflow</a>
  repository.
</p>
<h3>FOLIO-FSE Migration Tools</h3>
<p>
  Stanford's DAGs use the open-source tools  <a href="https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/folio_migration_tools/">FOLIO Migration Tools</a> 
  and <a href="https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/FolioClient">FolioClient</a> developed by Ebsco's FOLIO-FSE team for the majority of 
  the core migration from MARC21 binary and tab-separated files (TSV) to FOLIO Instances, Holdings, and Items records. 
</p>
<h2>Directed Acyclic Graph Workflows</h2>
<h3><em>auto_bib_loads</em> DAG</h3>
<p>
  To start the workflow, we copy MARC21 files along with those records holdings and items information into TSV files into a 
  mounted directory in the Airflow environment.  
</p>
<img src="assets/auto_bib_loads.png" alt="Auto BIB Loads DAG Graph" style="width: 1000px;"/>
<h4>Tasks for <em>auto_bib_load</em> DAG</h4>
<ol>
  <li>When the DAG is manually triggered, the <strong>create_bib_loads</strong> task iterates
  through the mounted directory and creates groupings of records.</li>
  <li>As a temporary fix, the <strong>launch_ol_management</strong> task triggers the <em>optimistic_locking_management</em> 
  DAG that removes the optimistic locking of FOLIO inventory records to facilitate easier batch imports.</li>
  <li>The final task, <strong>launch_bib_imports</strong> triggers multiple runs of <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG based on 
   the number of record groups from the <strong>create_bib_loads</strong>. The <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG is configured
   so the maximum number of simultaneous is three, with any remaining DAG runs being queued and launched when one of three
   slots open up after a DAG run is completed</li>
</ol>
<h3><em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG</h3>
<p>
  The primary DAG for migrating MARC bibliographic records, the <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG is composed of three
  TaskGroups, <strong>move-transform</strong>, <strong>marc21-and-tsv-folio</strong>, and finally <strong>post-to-folio</strong>
</p>

<h4>Move-Tranform TaskGroup</h4>
<img src="assets/move-transforms-taskgroup.png" alt="Move-Transform TaskGroup" style="width: 1000px">
<p>
  The purpose of the <strong>move-transform</strong> is to take the MARC 21 file along with it's corresponding tsv files
  and prepare the files for later processing in the <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG. </p> For example, 
<ul>
  <li>In the MARC file, the first 001 field contains the CATKEY, the Symphony record identifier, that needs to be 
      prefixed with an <em>a</em>. The remaining 001 fields are moved to the 035 fields.</li>
  <li>For the TSV files, the CATKEY is also prefixed with an <em>a</em> character and the spaces are removed from the 
      BARCODE rows</li>
</ul>
<p>
  After the changes are made, the files are moved into file directories that the 
  <a href="https://github.com/FOLIO-FSE/folio_migration_tools/">folio_migration_tools</a> expect when run. 
</p>
<h4>MARC21 and TSV to FOLIO TaskGroup</h4>
<img src="assets/marc21-and-tsv-to-folio-taskgroup.png" alt="MARC21 and TSV to FOLIO Records TaskGroup" style="width: 1000px"/>
<h4>Post to FOLIO TaskGroup</h4>
<img src="assets/post-to-folio-taskgroup.png" alt="POST FOLIO Records to FOLIO" style="width: 1000px" />
<p>
  When posting records to FOLIO, each record type is batched and depending on the configuration, one or more parallel
  tasks are initiated and separate POST calls are made. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The first parallel POSTs occurs for the Instance records</li>
  <li>Check is made and for MARC only workloads and either exits the task-group or continues</li>
  <li>The second parallel POSTs occurs for the Holdings records</li>
  <li>The third parallel POSTs occur for the Items records</li>
</ol>
<h3><em>ingest_marc_to_srs</em> DAG</h3>
<img src="assets/add_marc_to_srs.png" alt="MARC to FOLIO Source Record Storage" />
<p>
 This DAG is triggered by the last <em>symphony_marc_import</em> tasks. 
</p>
<ol>
 <li>Uses the FOLIO Migration Tools' BatchPoster, the SRS JSON records generated in the calling DAG, are
 posted to Okapi</li>
 <li>Leverages the fallback capabilities of the BatchPoster when a batch POST 
 fails. This also decouples the initial Inventory record ingestion with the often slower 
 SRS batch module.</li>
</ol>
<h3><em>fix_failed_record_loads</em> DAG</h3>
<img src="assets/fix_failed_record_loads.png" alt="Fix Record Loads"  style="width: 1000px"/>
<p>
 When a batch POST fails (Instance, Holdings, or Items), we capture the failed records for processing
 in this DAG triggered by the completion of <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG run. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>First remediation of Instance failed records are posted by individual record to Okapi 
      <strong>instances-handler</strong> task.
  </li>
  <li>Next, remediation of Holding failed individual records are posted to Okapi
      <strong>holdings-handler</strong> task.
  </li>
  <li>Finally, remediation of single Item failed records are posted to Okapi
      <strong>items-handler</strong> task.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Future functionality would add error specific remediation would occur; for example when the 
  _version is incorrect due to optimistic locking, the current record's _version would be 
  retrieved and used in the individual record to be posted to Okapi.
</p>
<h2>Recent Functionality</h2>

<h3>Proceeding/Succeeding Titles</h3>
<p>
  We are currently extending the FOLIO Migration tools to support proceeding and succeeding titles
  in the record loads. During the <strong>convert_marc_to_folio_instances</strong> task, we are appending the 
  proceeding/succeeding records to a file for further processing. 
</p>
<p>
 We are building a separate DAG that reads the file created and that is triggered after the Instance POSTs 
 are completed. This DAG then POSTs the records individual to Okapi.
</p>
<h3>MHLD (MARC Holdings Records) and On-Order </h3>
<p>
  In active development, we are building functionality to support MARC Holdings records (MHLDs) ingestion into 
  FOLIO that will allow us to generate FOLIO Holdings records from MHLD records. This will add at least a 
  couple of tasks to the <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG.
</p>
<p>
  We also are working on migrating our current On-Order MARC records that require some modification of existing
  tasks in the <em>symphony_marc_import</em> DAG.
